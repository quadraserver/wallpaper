# Wallpaper
Here is a "Top 30" collection of nice desktop wallpapers, which will fit also tiling window managers, desktops and login-screens.

Feel free to use them to your liking.

To use it, just copy over my repository with the following command:

git clone "https://www.github.com/quadraserver/wallpaper.git"

There will also be a bash script available, which copies the content to the folder '/usr/share/backgrounds/Wallpaper'.
Here you can access it from any desktop, tiling window manager, or even from every user on your (Linux) system.
