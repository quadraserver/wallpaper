# wallpaper
Here is my collection of free desktop wallpapers, that fits also tiling window managers, desktops and login-screens .

There will also be a bash script available, which copies the content to the folder '/usr/share/backgrounds/Wallpaper' where you can access it from any desktop, tiling window manager, or even user.
